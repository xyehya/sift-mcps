# SIFT Gateway — Security Model (canonical reference)

## The model in one paragraph
The **Gateway is the single policy boundary**: every REST call, every MCP tool call,
every privileged action passes through it. **Postgres is the authoritative control
plane** (FORCE RLS); **OpenSearch is derived and never authoritative**. AI agents reach
tools only through the aggregate `/mcp`; humans use the React portal at `/portal`. Heavy
work runs as durable Postgres jobs claimed by least-privilege workers, and deep execution
is confined to an **OS-sandboxed `run_command` plane**. There is no second door.

## VP-1 — System context: who the gateway serves
Only two consumer classes exist — a **human operator** over HTTPS to `/portal`, and an
**AI agent** over MCP to `/mcp` (Supabase JWT, `/mcp` only). Both terminate at one system.
The lone external dependency, **OpenCTI**, is reached *through* the gateway under a
query-only contract — the agent never talks to it directly.

## VP-2 — Eight planes, one gate
Authority flows one way: **Postgres (control plane) is the source of truth**; OpenSearch
(data plane) is a derived projection rebuilt from artifacts, never trusted as the system of
record. Heavy work doesn't block the agent — the gateway **enqueues a durable job**,
least-privilege workers **claim** it under a lease, confined execution writes results back
up to Postgres and out to the derived index. Evidence is operator-mounted and immutable;
reports only ever contain approved material.

| Plane | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| ① Client | Operator Portal (React/Vite, `/portal`, human-only REST) + AI Agent clients (Supabase JWT, `/mcp` only) |
| ② **Gateway — single policy boundary** (`pkg: sift-gateway`) | HTTP middleware stack (SecureHeaders → HTTPSGuard → NormalizePath → CORS → Auth; auth skips `/mcp`, which owns its own) · the 9-stage MCP tool-call chain · REST routes (`rest.py`, portal/operator) · backend aggregator (`mcp_backends_registry`, `http_backend`, `stdio_backend`) |
| ③ Core in-process tools (`sift-core`) | `run_command` (OS-sandboxed exec) · `record_finding`/`record_timeline`/todo · case/evidence/reporting/verify |
| ④ **Control plane — AUTHORITATIVE** (Supabase/Postgres, FORCE RLS) | identity + JWT principals · active-case authority · evidence custody (append-only chains) · durable jobs/steps/logs · audit events (append-only) · report+approval ledger · `mcp_backends` registry · opensearch provenance · rag pgvector |
| ⑤ Add-on MCP backends (`app.mcp_backends`) | **opensearch-mcp** (CORE, ns `opensearch`) · **forensic-rag-mcp** (CORE, ns `kb`, pgvector, knowledge-only) · **opencti-mcp** (EXTERNAL, `cti_*`, query-only) |
| ⑥ **Data plane — DERIVED** (OpenSearch, security ON, per-consumer scoped roles) | `case-*` indices · `opencti_*`/timeline · N ingest workers `sift-opensearch-worker@` (least-priv, parallel, non-blocking) |
| ⑦ Execution plane (SIFT VM) | `sift-job-worker` (claim `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, lease 300s, poll 1s; types run_command/ingest/enrich) · sandboxed `run_command` (Landlock v4 + seccomp=kill + cgroup + AppArmor=enforce) |
| ⑧ Evidence & reports | Evidence Vault (immutable raw bytes + sha256, `chattr +i`, manifest+ledger, operator-mounted only) · Reports/Exports (APPROVED findings & data only) |

## VP-3 — One ordered path, nine fail-closed gates
Every agent tool call traverses this fixed chain (verified in `mcp_server.py` +
`policy_middleware.py`). **A deny at any stage short-circuits to an audited MCP error — the
tool body never runs.** Identity is resolved *before* the chain begins.

**Identity** — `SiftTokenVerifier` verifies the Supabase JWT → principal (type · scopes ·
case). *(Design doc says "PR02 hash / api_key fallback" — REMOVED by SEC-6; Supabase is sole
authority, fail-closed on outage.)*

1. **GatewayToolCatalog** — filter the catalog to what this principal may even see.
2. **ToolAuthorization** (B-10) — fail-closed if no identity · deny on tool_scope · rate limit.
3. **AddonAuthority** (H1) — enforce `authority_contract` + `required_scopes` · deny prohibited add-on ops.
4. **CaseContext** — inject the DB active-case context (no env / pointer trust).
5. **AuditEnvelope** — pre-dispatch DB audit write · fail-closed for write tools · append-only.
6. **ProxyActiveCase** — propagate the active case to the proxied add-on backend.
7. **EvidenceGate** — REQUIRE evidence registered + sealed + `chain_status` OK, else block. *(the hard interlock)*
8. **ResponseGuard** — redact secrets → `[REDACTED:*]` · label untrusted output · no path/traceback leaks.
9. **OpenSearchJobDispatch** — ingest/enrich → durable worker job, non-blocking (returns `job_id`).

→ **Tool body executes** — core in-process tool OR proxied add-on — only now, only if all gates passed. Result returns redacted · audited · with `job_id` if dispatched.

Fail-closed defaults: no identity → reject · tool out of scope → reject · prohibited add-on
op → reject · evidence unsealed → block · audit write fails → block.

## VP-4 — STRIDE trust boundaries and the control that closes each
Seven boundaries; every flow crosses at least one. (S poofing · T ampering · R epudiation ·
I nfo disclosure · D oS · E levation.) The two a forensic system lives or dies on are **#2**
(evidence can never be silently mutated) and **#6** (tool output is treated as hostile and
scrubbed before re-entering the agent's context — the prompt-injection-from-evidence defense).

| # | Trust boundary | STRIDE | Enforcing control |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Client → Gateway single policy boundary; per-backend `/mcp` routes disabled | S T R E | `AuthMiddleware` + `SiftTokenVerifier` (Supabase JWT); `ToolAuthorization` fail-closed on no identity / out-of-scope |
| 2 | Execution/Core → Evidence Vault immutability | T R I | `EvidenceGate` (sealed + chain OK before any tool runs); `chattr +i`; append-only custody chains |
| 3 | Worker → OS Sandbox privilege confinement | E D T | Landlock v4 + seccomp=kill + AppArmor=enforce + no-new-privs; cgroup `MemoryMax`/`TasksMax`, `IPAddressDeny=any`; runtime-user fail-closed |
| 4 | Gateway → Control Plane authority | T R E | Postgres authoritative + `FORCE RLS`; `active_case_authority` (no env/pointer state); append-only audit |
| 5 | Gateway/Add-ons → Data Plane derived-data | T I E | OpenSearch never authoritative; per-consumer scoped roles; provenance; case-scoped mediated search |
| 6 | Tool output → Agent untrusted-output | I T | `ResponseGuard`: secret patterns → `[REDACTED:*]`, untrusted-output labelling, no path/traceback leaks |
| 7 | Operator → privileged action human step-up | S R E | Supabase fail-closed re-verify (CL3a/b) on case activation, evidence seal/retire, finding approval, report export, credential issuance; `approval_ledger` |

## VP-5 — The `run_command` jail (ceiling + floor, both deny-default)
`run_command(command: str)` runs `shell=False`, multi-stage argv (supports `| && || ; > >> < 2>&1`)
as the `agent_runtime` uid on the SIFT VM. Two stacked layers gate it before any forensic
binary runs. The ceiling reasons about *intent*; the floor enforces *capability* at the kernel.

**CEILING — policy** (`sift-core/execute/security.py`):
allowlist `@mvp_forensic` (`unlisted_policy = contained`, fail-closed) · program-text scanners
(sed/sqlite3/tshark/vol/exiftool) · block shells & interpreters (sh/bash/python/perl/ruby/node ·
awk system/getline) · env deny-after-allow (dotnet/ld*/python/…) · `/var/lib/sift` hard block +
cross-case access denied · output sanitation (ANSI/OSC strip · untrusted label · secret redaction).

**FLOOR — kernel/OS** (`dfir_exec_launcher.py` + `worker.py`):
runtime-user fail-closed (`SIFT_EXECUTE_REQUIRE_RUNTIME_USER`, `agent_runtime` uid) ·
`systemd-run --scope` (`MemoryMax=4G TasksMax=64 OOMPolicy=kill IPAddressDeny=any`) ·
no-new-privs · Landlock ABI v4 (FS+net deny-default) · **seccomp = KILL** (SIGSYS on disallowed
syscall) · AppArmor `dfir-exec` = ENFORCE. Landlock grants read-only: case/evidence paths,
`/etc/mime.types`, `/proc/N/fd` — nothing else is reachable.

## Notation key (for the rendered HTML diagrams)
Color encodes a node's plane and trust: Gateway = the single boundary everything crosses ·
Control plane (Postgres) = authoritative · Data plane (OpenSearch) = derived, never authoritative ·
Execution = confined sandbox · Evidence/reports = immutable bytes, approved-only outputs ·
Client (operator + agent) = untrusted by default. Shapes: rounded = process/component · sharp =
external actor · cylinder = data store · red-dashed = trust boundary · double line = workers claim
durable jobs (lease) · dashed arrow = async/derived/poll.
