# Migration State

## Current Objective

Current-state repository inventory completed. The migration workspace now has a
grounded inventory of frontend, Gateway/backend, MCP, JSON/file state, evidence
vault, native workflows, OpenSearch, tests, docs, and setup.

## Decisions Already Made

- Supabase/Postgres is the authoritative control plane.
- Human operators use Supabase Auth and RLS.
- Agents, MCP clients, workers, and backend services use Gateway-issued, case-scoped MCP/service tokens.
- MCP/service tokens are stored in the Postgres token registry as hashes only.
- Gateway validates MCP/service tokens and enforces tool scope, case scope, expiry, revocation, and policy before MCP or workflow actions.
- Postgres is authoritative for token registry state, case permissions, audit events, durable job state, evidence metadata, approval state, and workflow state.
- Immutable raw evidence and cryptographic ledger artifacts are preserved as proof/export while control-plane state moves to Postgres.
- OpenSearch is integrated through Gateway policy as a core derived search/data plane, initially by adapting existing OpenSearch code.
- OpenSearch must not become the authority for cases, tokens, jobs, evidence integrity, or approvals.
- No Redis/RQ.

- Targeted `find`, `tree`, and `rg` scans for repo/package structure, frontend API usage, Starlette routes, MCP registration, JSON state, evidence, audit, tokens, OpenSearch, jobs/workflows, tests, docs, setup files, Redis/RQ/Celery, and Supabase/Postgres presence.

## Open Questions

- What exact Supabase Local deployment shape should this repo target?
- What are the eventual Postgres schema boundaries for cases, jobs, evidence metadata, audit events, approvals, and token registry state?
- What OpenSearch index naming, job linkage, and provenance conventions should become canonical?
- What is the safest migration cutover order from JSON/file authority to Postgres authority?

## Next Recommended Run

Use `docs/migration/01_repo_inventory.md` to start target-state data/control-plane
planning. Recommended scope: identify authoritative Postgres/Supabase domains
and boundaries for cases, tokens, evidence metadata, audit, approvals, reports,
and durable jobs. Do not implement code yet, and do not produce the final
roadmap until the target-state model is grounded.
