# Session Notes

Status: sprint log and decision register.
Last updated: 2026-06-14.

## Format Rules

- Latest change entry stays at the top of `Current Change Log`.
- Use `Status: DONE`, `Status: IN_PROGRESS`, or `Status: BLOCKED`.
- Keep forks/backlog/needs-input in the single table below.
- Use IDs beginning with `B-MVP-` for backlog/needs-input.
- Do not create extra migration runbooks.

## Current Change Log

### 2026-06-14 - RUN-3 is locally merged on main; non-MCP live gate is green

Status: IN_PROGRESS

Changed:
- `run3/integrate` changes are now in local `main`.
- Local gates are green for `sift-core`/`sift-gateway`; strict security slice is green under local run3 settings.
- Live gate run (operator-restricted): `health` and restart checks pass; direct non-MCP floor probes confirm runtime confinement and network/FS denies.

Validation:
- `uv run --extra dev --extra full pytest packages/sift-core/tests -q`
- `uv run --extra dev --extra full pytest packages/sift-gateway/tests -q`
- `SIFT_RUN3_GATE_STRICT=1 uv run --extra dev --extra full pytest packages/sift-core/tests/security -q`
- `python3 scripts/validate_docs.py`
- `python3 scripts/validate_migration_docs.py`
- `git diff --check`

Next:
- Complete MCP-only positive forensic matrix and negative red-team matrix via in-session configured SIFT MCP tools.
- Flip `SIFT_EXECUTE_SECCOMP_MODE` to `kill` only after positive matrix is green.
- Patch AppArmor enforcement findings from burn-in and prove evidence immutability/sha checks end-to-end.
- Push only after final `security-review` + MCP/portal gates pass.

### 2026-06-14 - RUN-3 design and build model frozen

Status: DONE

Changed:
- Canonical spec set for `run_command` hardening is `docs/research/run_command-FINAL-SPEC.md`.
- Canonical execution model for implementation is `docs/RUN3-run_command-hardening-BUILD-PLAN.md` (4 batches in Wave-1/Wave-2 flow).

Validation:
- `docs/migration/Session-Notes.md` and `docs/migration/task-batches.md` updated as the two active planning docs.
- Existing implementation artifacts were lint/validator aligned at that time.

Next:
- Keep RUN-3 batch gates as the first startup priority in future sessions.
- Treat the full FINAL-SPEC as reference-only and use targeted extraction from key sections only.

### 2026-06-12 - Operator readiness model refreshed; decision log reset to two-file tracker

Status: DONE

Changed:
- Operating model was collapsed from long historical batch prose to the active two-doc mode:
  `docs/migration/task-batches.md` + `docs/migration/Session-Notes.md`.
- AGENTS/CLAUDE were aligned to this model and live proofs were standardized around `/health`, service status, and MCP-auth via portal-issued credentials.

Validation:
- `python3 scripts/validate_docs.py`
- `python3 scripts/validate_migration_docs.py`
- `git diff --check`

Next:
- Continue with BATCH-OR/LV hardening flow and complete RUN-3 MCP gates before push.

## Forks / Backlog / Needs Input

| ID | Type | Status | Decision / Input Needed | Owner Batch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B-MVP-002 | Backlog | OPEN | Rename repo to `ProtocolSiftGateway` is decided at architecture level; CL2 pending operator/infra timing. | BATCH-CL2 |
| B-MVP-006 | Backlog | OPEN | Confirm portal knowledge-document policy for shared/reference-only behavior in PT2. | BATCH-PT2 |
| B-MVP-012 | Backlog | DEFERRED | Self-managed Supabase compose remains deferred after LV1; confirm non-lab deployment timing. | BATCH-SB1 |
| B-MVP-019 | Backlog | OPEN | Ensure add-on register path fields are sourced from staged `/opt/sift-mcps` paths for first real add-on launch. | BATCH-LV1 |
| B-MVP-023 | Backlog | OPEN | Decide whether to keep legacy `legacy_portal_session_enabled` fallback or fully delete legacy session branch/tests. | BATCH-HR3 |
| B-MVP-026 | Backlog | OPEN | Complete RUN-3 MCP positive/negative matrix, seccomp kill flip, AppArmor enforce flip, and evidence integrity proof. | BATCH-R3-* |

## Validation Commands

Run at the end of documentation/planning sessions:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_docs.py
python3 scripts/validate_migration_docs.py
git diff --check
```

Add targeted code tests for any touched implementation package.
