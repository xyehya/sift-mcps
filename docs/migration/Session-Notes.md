# Session Notes

Status: sprint log and decision register.
Last updated: 2026-06-12.

## Format Rules

- Latest change entry stays at the top of `Current Change Log`.
- Use `Status: DONE`, `Status: IN_PROGRESS`, or `Status: BLOCKED`.
- Keep forks, blockers, and needs-input in the single table below.
- Use IDs beginning with `F-MVP-` for forks and `B-MVP-` for backlog/needs-input.
- Do not create more migration runbooks.

## Current Change Log

### 2026-06-12 - Discovery wave landed: OR1, OR2, OR4, HR1

Status: DONE (four parallel worktree batches merged to local main; not pushed)

Changed: Landed the first operator-readiness discovery wave as four parallel
worker batches, one commit each, merged linearly onto main:

- BATCH-OR1 `docs/inventory/sift-tool-inventory.md` plus read-only helper
  `scripts/inventory-sift-tools.sh` - live-VM command-backed tool/path/service/
  Docker inventory with missing-tool grouping.
- BATCH-OR2 `docs/operator/state-authority-map.md` - 40+ row mutable-state
  authority table; confirms evidence custody is DB-authoritative
  (`app.evidence_seal`; manifest/ledger are export/proof only) and lists
  `docs/regenerate/**` stale-authority claims for RG1.
- BATCH-OR4 `docs/operator/reference-data-provenance.md` - RAG/forensic-
  knowledge/Hayabusa provenance traces plus an external-download ledger
  (D1-D8): uv, Hayabusa, and BGE model downloads are unpinned/unverified;
  GeoIP datasource hits a live endpoint; only uv.lock/PyPI passes cleanly.
- BATCH-HR1 `docs/hardening/research-matrix.md` - 16-component official-source
  hardening matrix (URLs + 2026-06-12 retrieval dates). Top gaps: systemd units
  have zero hardening directives; AppArmor complain-only with stale profile
  paths; OpenSearch security plugin disabled; sentence-transformers has no
  offline/revision pin; Supabase CLI demo keys vs production posture.

Notable live-VM facts from OR1: Volatility 3 is `vol`/`volshell` (no `vol3`
name); yara is python3-yara only (no CLI); `uv` lives in the operator home, off
the service PATH; config/env files live under `/var/lib/sift/.sift/` with 0600
modes; ~4.4 GB of OpenCTI add-on images are present but not running on the
core VM; Volatility symbol cache is empty; `/opt/sift-mcps/.DS_Store` is stray.

New backlog/needs-input rows registered below: B-MVP-007..013 (the four
decision items from worker landing logs are typed Needs input per the
validator contract that bans persistent OPEN fork rows).

Validation: `python3 scripts/validate_docs.py` OK;
`python3 scripts/validate_migration_docs.py` OK; `git diff --check` clean;
`bash -n scripts/inventory-sift-tools.sh` OK; secret-pattern scan over all
four diffs clean (paths/modes recorded, values redacted).

Next: Run BATCH-OR3 (operator maintenance manual + variable dictionary)
consuming OR1/OR2/OR4 outputs. Then HR2 can start from the HR1 matrix plus
OR1/OR2 facts.

### 2026-06-12 - Operator readiness and hardening track opened

Status: DONE (docs/planning reset; implementation batches opened)

Changed: Replaced the long completed-batch tracker with a second-phase
operator-readiness program in `docs/migration/task-batches.md`, and refreshed
`AGENTS.md` around the current operating model. The new track covers the user
requested work: full operator maintenance docs, variables/secrets/config maps,
file-state versus DB-authority discovery, official hardening research and audit
guides, live SIFT tool inventory, RAG/FK/Hayabusa provenance, legacy cleanup,
ProtocolSiftGateway/add_ons restructuring, add-on spec and conformance proof,
portal health/case/RAG improvements, certificate strategy, regenerate-doc
modernization, and final live VM validation.

Reasoning: The current codebase has crossed the main migration milestone. The
remaining risk is no longer "does the core migration exist?" but "can an
operator understand, maintain, harden, extend, and prove it without rediscovery?"
The old detailed batch history was useful during migration but now slows future
sessions down. It is retained in git history; this file now keeps only the
current baseline, decisions, open inputs, and proof notes.

Current baseline:

- Core stack: Gateway, sift-core, portal, Supabase/Postgres, OpenSearch,
  forensic-rag-mcp/pgvector, forensic-knowledge, Hayabusa, local worker, and
  installer/systemd services.
- External add-ons: OpenCTI and future Windows-triage style tools. They must
  install through the add-on contract, not the native core installer.
- Fresh installer baseline from the last live run: clone-entry `./install.sh`
  stages into `/opt/sift-mcps`; `/health` is `status=ok`; `sift-gateway.service`
  and `sift-job-worker.service` are active; OpenSearch and RAG backend rows use
  `/opt/sift-mcps/.venv/bin/opensearch-mcp` and
  `/opt/sift-mcps/.venv/bin/rag-mcp`; `app.rag_chunks` is populated; portal auth
  works for `examiner@operators.sift.local`; MCP auth still needs a portal-issued
  agent/service credential for final tools/list smoke.
- Docs seed material: `docs/regenerate/**` is useful but stale. Future batches
  must verify it against source/live state before promoting it.

Validation: `python3 scripts/validate_docs.py` OK;
`python3 scripts/validate_migration_docs.py` OK; `git diff --check` clean.

Next: Start BATCH-OR1, BATCH-OR2, BATCH-OR4, and BATCH-HR1 in parallel. Then use
their outputs to write BATCH-OR3, the operator maintenance manual.

### 2026-06-12 - Installer health contract for mounted native stdio backends

Status: DONE (host patch; live VM rerun verified)

Changed: Gateway `/health` now treats mounted idle stdio proxy backends as ready,
while unmounted stopped backends remain degraded. Installer idempotent Supabase
bootstrap now preserves an existing operator mapping so handoff text points at
the actual Supabase login path.

Live proof: Fresh rerun cleaned stale installer probes, confirmed no OpenCTI
containers/volumes/indices, ran `./install.sh` from `~/sift-mcps`, and exited 0.
Post-run `/health` returned `status=ok`, both system services were active, RAG
pgvector had rows, OpenSearch was healthy, and portal login with the handoff
operator succeeded with `must_reset=true`. An operator Supabase login token
correctly failed MCP auth with `invalid_token`; final MCP tools/list waits on a
portal-issued agent/service credential.

Validation: `bash -n install.sh scripts/setup-addon.sh scripts/setup-supabase.sh`
OK; focused gateway tests OK; `python3 scripts/validate_docs.py` OK;
`python3 scripts/validate_migration_docs.py` OK; `git diff --check` clean.

Next: Continue with the operator-issued MCP credential smoke under BATCH-LV1
after portal reset/credential issuance.

## Forks / Backlog / Needs Input

| ID | Type | Status | Decision / Input Needed | Owner Batch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B-MVP-001 | Needs input | OPEN | Certificate profile: public DNS plus Let's Encrypt/ACME, or internal/local CA for lab IP-only VM. | BATCH-TLS1 |
| B-MVP-002 | Needs input | OPEN | Repo rename details: GitHub remote/name, runtime install path compatibility (`/opt/sift-mcps` vs `/opt/ProtocolSiftGateway`), and whether Python package names stay unchanged. | BATCH-CL2 |
| B-MVP-003 | Backlog | OPEN | Windows triage is currently not core. Decide whether to rebuild it now as an external add-on or leave it as an author-guide example. | BATCH-AD2 |
| B-MVP-004 | Needs input | OPEN | Hardened/offline download policy: allow live Hugging Face/GitHub downloads during install, pre-bundle/cache artifacts, or require operator-provided artifacts. | BATCH-OR4 / BATCH-HR2 |
| B-MVP-005 | Backlog | OPEN | Decide production OpenSearch posture beyond single-node lab/yellow health: replica settings, security plugin, auth, snapshot policy, and multi-node option. | BATCH-HR2 / BATCH-HR3 |
| B-MVP-006 | Backlog | OPEN | Portal RAG document management must decide whether operator-added docs are global knowledge only or can create case-derived chunks with strict provenance. | BATCH-PT2 |
| B-MVP-010 | Needs input | OPEN | `gateway.yaml` stores `portal.session_secret` as an inline literal (file is 0600/sift-service). Decide whether to env-indirect it like the DSN/pepper. | BATCH-HR3 |
| B-MVP-011 | Needs input | OPEN | Retire legacy file-mode fallbacks: `examiner.json` PBKDF2 auth fallback and the file-mode HMAC verification ledger (superseded by DB `content_hash`). Confirm dead on live VM first. | BATCH-CL1 / BATCH-HR3 |
| B-MVP-012 | Needs input | OPEN | Verify whether installed VMs still run Supabase CLI demo JWT keys/default DB password; decide rotation path for production posture. | BATCH-HR2 / BATCH-HR3 |
| B-MVP-013 | Needs input | OPEN | RLS enable/FORCE posture on `app.*` control-plane tables is unconfirmed; enabling is a schema change beyond HR3's safe-installer scope. Verify in HR2, then decide. | BATCH-HR2 |
| B-MVP-007 | Backlog | OPEN | ~4.4 GB of OpenCTI add-on images sit on the core VM unused. Document add-on image lifecycle/cleanup so core installs do not silently carry add-on payloads. | BATCH-AD2 |
| B-MVP-008 | Backlog | OPEN | Volatility symbol cache is empty (on-demand fetch). Document symbol provisioning for air-gapped operation. | BATCH-OR3 / BATCH-HR3 |
| B-MVP-009 | Backlog | OPEN | Installer staging hygiene: exclude `.DS_Store` from `/opt/sift-mcps`; verify no code references the literal `vol3` or a `yara` CLI (neither exists on the VM). | BATCH-CL1 |
