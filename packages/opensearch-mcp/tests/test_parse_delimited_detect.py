"""Tests for `_detect_delimited_format` quote-aware variance check.

Regression pin for the Hayabusa silent-drop bug: pre-fix, the variance
check counted raw delimiter characters per line, so a 142 MB Hayabusa
CSV with 89k+ detection rows got classified `unknown` and the walker
skipped it — dropping WMI Persistence + 88,999 other hits. The fix
swaps raw char counting for `csv.reader`-based field-count variance,
which is quote-aware.
