Verdict Calculation Logic for Windows Triage

This module implements the verdict calculation system that determines the
final assessment for files, processes, services, and hashes based on
OFFLINE analysis against local baselines.

For threat intelligence (MALICIOUS verdict), use opencti-mcp separately.

Verdict Categories (in priority order):

    SUSPICIOUS - Anomalies or suspicious patterns detected
        - Hash mismatch on known path (trojanized binary)
        - Protected process name in wrong location (svchost.exe in C:\\Temp)
        - Unicode evasion (RLO attacks, homoglyphs)
        - Double extensions (invoice.pdf.exe)
        - Unexpected process parent (Word spawning cmd.exe)
        - Known tool patterns (mimikatz.exe)
        - LOLBin in non-standard location
        - Vulnerable driver detected

    EXPECTED_LOLBIN - Matches baseline AND is a LOLBin
        - LOLBin in expected location (certutil.exe in System32)
        - Legitimate Windows tool that can be abused for malicious purposes

    EXPECTED - Matches Windows baseline, no risk factors
        - Path and/or filename found in VanillaWindowsReference
        - No LOLBin, no suspicious patterns

    UNKNOWN - Not in any database (NEUTRAL, not suspicious)
        - Our baseline cannot cover all legitimate software
        - Third-party apps, enterprise tools, or newer Windows components
        - Only flag as suspicious if actual indicators present

Key Design Decisions:

    1. Verdict Priority: SUSPICIOUS > EXPECTED_LOLBIN > EXPECTED > UNKNOWN
       Higher-risk verdicts always take precedence to prevent false negatives.

    2. UNKNOWN is neutral: Being absent from our baseline is NOT suspicious.
       Many legitimate applications won't be in VanillaWindowsReference.

    3. Path + filename validation: A file can be EXPECTED even if only the
       filename matches baseline AND it's in a system directory.

    4. Protected process detection: Critical system processes (svchost.exe,
       lsass.exe, csrss.exe) in non-system paths are always SUSPICIOUS.

    5. No MALICIOUS verdict: This module is offline-only. For threat
       intelligence lookups, use opencti-mcp which can return MALICIOUS.
